# ✈️ British Airways Data Science Project

This project explores British Airways customer data using data science, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques. It includes **sentiment analysis of customer reviews** alongside traditional predictive modeling to better understand customer satisfaction and feedback patterns.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Task 1:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) + Sentiment Analysis
- **Task 2:** Machine Learning Modeling and Evaluation

---

## 🔍 Task 1 - EDA + Sentiment Analysis

### ✨ Key Components:
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, formatting
- 📊 **Statistical Analysis** – Distributions, trends, correlation
- 💬 **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- 🧠 **Sentiment Analysis**
  - Analyzing customer review texts
  - Assigning polarity scores (positive, negative, neutral)
  - Visualizing sentiment trends across customer segments

**Goal:** Understand patterns in customer satisfaction and sentiment to identify service strengths and pain points.

---

## 🤖 Task 2 - Machine Learning Modeling

### ✅ Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- (Optional: LightGBM, Decision Tree, etc.)

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance Analysis

**Goal:** Predict customer satisfaction and identify critical influencing factors.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- NLTK / SpaCy (for sentiment analysis)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Business Value

- Understand **customer sentiment** directly from text reviews
- Predict **customer dissatisfaction** before churn happens
- Improve **service strategies** with data-driven insights
